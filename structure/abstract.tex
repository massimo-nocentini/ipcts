    \noindent In this document we collect pieces of code
    to understand \emph{corecursion} and \emph{coinduction}.
    This should support a presentation for the PhD level
    course \emph{Introduction to Process Calculi and 
    related Type Systems} taught at the University of Florence
    during December 2015 by professors Ilaria Castellani and
    Rosario Pugliese.
